                                Work with the company SOFWERX to develop software that is a telemetric data interpreter for a digital twin drone.
                                Software consisted of 10 user stories that were determined by a collaboration of the team and SOFWERX. 
                                My role was director, designer, and developer of the project.

                            <h5>My Contributions</h5>
                            <p class="tab card-text">
                                As a director of the project, I was tasked with charging each member with their responsibilities; whether it was researching, designing, developing, or testing. 
                                Furthermore, I provided leadership by assisting the team members with any difficulties they were facing. For instance, at the start of the project there were difficulties 
                                connecting with SOFWERX. This led to me setting a meeting for our team and leading a conversation for the direction we wanted our project to go in.
                            </p>
                            <p class="tab card-text">
                                As a designer of the project, I was tasked with designing how we recieved the data from our drone, what we could do with that data, and how that data would be used for the users benefit.
                                Albeit the user stories were determined through collaboration, I designed the details and algorithms for our software to accomplish those user stories. 
                                An example would be the design for the battery algorithm. This algorithm would take the rate of decay for each dataset recieved, and would predict how long the current battery will last. 
                                However, this design had a major flaw; the prediction would greatly skew based on whether the drone was idling in the air, or accelerating in any direction. 
                                In order to solve this issue, I designed the algorithm to analyze the data in larger instances. This allowed for a more accurate and steady reading of battery life.
                            </p>
                            <p class="tab card-text">
                                As a developer, I was tasked with coding the design and testing the code. I developed a majority of the algorithms used in the back-end including: parsing through the data, simulation of data input, 
                                determining weather conditions, and simulation of a sensor for object detection. Additionally, I developed the user-interface for the project. However, I was only able to develop 
                                a command line interface due to time constraints with the project.

                            depicting the importance of each cell, I would 0 out the most important cell and run the image through the model again. 
                            This technique would be repeated up to 16 times for each in-correctly classified image by the model.
